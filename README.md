# HFBendingFatigue

What is the purpose of writing this code?

Studying the shape of the specimen and stress distribution along the thin-plate small-sized specimen for high-frequency bending fatigue testing

What does this code do?

This code was used to study the natural frequencies, mode shapes, deflection shape, stress distribution, strain distribution, maximum normal bending stress, maximum bending moment, etc. for a cantilever beam. The cantilever beam is the model for a high-frequency bending-fatigue test specimen. The clamped end of the test specimen moves up/down in a vertical direction with a specific amplitude and frequency of 20kHz.

Codes Inputs:
- Material density
- Material modulus of elasticity
- Beamâ€™s geometry (size and thickness)

Codes Outputs:
- Natural frequency and mode shapes
- Deflection shapes in various amplitudes
- Stress distribution
- Deflections
- Moment Distribution
- Max stress/moment
- etc.
